#  Order/Task Management and Scheduling Simulator


## What's This About?

Based-off a challenge posted on the ReactJS Devs Group, a challenge was dropped by Ola (@1finedev) as follows:

**The Premise (Summary)**:  
Imagine a small coffee shop with two baristas (similar to the two attendants). Customers arrive at random times to place orders for coffee. Each coffee takes exactly 5 minutes to prepare.

- Each barista can work on up to 2 coffee orders at the same time (e.g., they can multitask).
- However, to avoid mistakes, if a barista starts a second order, they must wait at least 3 minutes after starting the first one (perhaps to ensure the first order is partially completed before starting the next).
- If a barista is already working on 2 orders, they cannot take any more until at least one of the orders is finished (after 5 minutes from the start of the second order).
- Customers are impatientâ€”if no barista can take their order immediately when they arrive, they leave without ordering.

The goal is to serve as many customers as possible without overloading the baristas.

## How It *Actually* Works

## Core System Architecture

### Event-Driven Simulation Engine
- **Priority Event Queue**:  
  Uses "heapq" to manage temporal events in chronological order
  ```python
  heapq.heappush(event_queue, Event(time, type, data))
  ```
- **Event Types**:
   - `order_arrival`: Triggered by new customer requests
   - `order_completion`: Scheduled 5 seconds after order acceptance

### Worker Management System
- **Attendant State Tracking**:
  ```python
  class Attendant:
      def update_state(self, current_time):
          # Maintains active orders and calculates availability
          self.active_orders = [t for t in self.active_orders if t + 5 > current_time]
  ```
- **Capacity Constraints**:
   - Maximum 2 concurrent orders per worker
   - 3-second cooldown after starting first order
   - Status states: active/inactive/overloaded

### Scheduling Logic
- **Order Assignment Algorithm**:
  ```python
  priority = (len(active_orders), random.random())
  ```
   - Primary factor: Current order load
   - Secondary factor: Randomization for load balancing
- **Automatic Completion Scheduling**:
  ```python
  heapq.heappush(event_queue, Event(current_time + 5, 'order_completion', ...)
  ```

### Key Workflow
1. Order arrival triggers event queue processing
2. System checks all attendant's availability:
   - Validates status (active/inactive).
   - Verifies temporal constraints (cooldown period).
   - Checks concurrent order limit.
3. Selects optimal worker using priority scoring
4. Updates worker state and schedules completion
5. Handles order rejection when no workers available
